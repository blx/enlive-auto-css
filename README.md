# enlive-selector-from-css

Tiny parser to translate CSS selectors into [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive)
selector vectors.

```clojure
user=> (require '[blx.enlive-selector-from-css :as ecss])
nil
user=> (ecss/translate-css "div.big > ul:last-of-type input.xyz[type=text]")
[:div.big :> [:ul html/last-of-type] [:input.xyz (html/attr= :type "text")]]
```

To change the enlive namespace of generated forms, pass it as the second argument:

```clojure
user=> (ecss/translate-css "#wow p:not(.red)" "enlive")
[:#wow [:p (enlive/but :.red)]]
```

No guarantees of robustness or usefulness are provided.
For such concerns, use a mature CSS parsing library â€” it won't
guarantee anything either, but that's the way it goes.

This has mostly been a practice exercise in Clojure (parsing, quoting)
and regexes, which keep you young or something, or at least regular.
